# Contributing to DCVM

Thank you for your interest in contributing to DCVM! This guide will help you understand the project structure and development workflow.

## Project Structure

DCVM follows a modular architecture. Please review [docs/project-structure.md](project-structure.md) for a complete overview.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Linux system (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+)
- KVM/QEMU virtualization support
- Root/sudo access
- Git

### Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/metharda/dcvm.git
cd dcvm
```

## Code Organization

### Adding New Features

1. **Determine the correct location:**
   - Core VM operations → `lib/core/`
   - Network features → `lib/network/`
   - Storage/backup → `lib/storage/`
   - Utilities → `lib/utils/`

2. **Create your script:**
   ```bash
   # Example: Adding a new network feature
   touch lib/network/my-feature.sh
   chmod +x lib/network/my-feature.sh
   ```

3. **Script template:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   #
   # Description of what this script does
   #
   
   set -euo pipefail
   
   # Source common utilities
   SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
   source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../utils/common.sh"
   
   # Load configuration
   load_dcvm_config
   
   # Your code here
   main() {
       print_info "Starting my feature..."
       # Implementation
       print_success "Feature completed!"
   }
   
   main "$@"
   ```

4. **Add route in `dcvm`:**
   ```bash
   # In the case statement
   my-feature)
       exec "$LIB_DIR/network/my-feature.sh" "$@"
       ;;
   ```

5. **Update documentation:**
   - Add command to `docs/usage.md`
   - Create example in `docs/examples/` if needed
   - Update README.md if it's a major feature

## Coding Standards

### Bash Best Practices

1. **Use strict mode:**
   ```bash
   set -euo pipefail
   ```

2. **Quote variables:**
   ```bash
   # Good
   echo "$variable"
   
   # Bad
   echo $variable
   ```

3. **Use functions:**
   ```bash
   my_function() {
       local param="$1"
       # Implementation
   }
   ```

4. **Error handling:**
   ```bash
   if ! some_command; then
       print_error "Command failed"
       return 1
   fi
   ```

5. **Use common utilities:**
   ```bash
   # Instead of echo
   print_info "Information message"
   print_success "Success message"
   print_warning "Warning message"
   print_error "Error message"
   
   # Instead of manual checks
   require_root
   check_dependencies virsh qemu-img
   validate_vm_name "$name"
   ```

### File Naming
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `my-script.sh`
- Be descriptive: `setup-port-forwarding.sh`
- Use `.sh` extension for shell scripts

### Comments
```bash
# Single-line comment

# Multi-line comment explaining
# complex logic or important notes
# about the implementation

#
# Section header for major parts
#
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test your changes
bash lib/core/your-script.sh

# Test through main CLI
./dcvm your-command
```

### Future: Automated Tests
When test framework is implemented:
```bash
# Run unit tests
./tests/unit/test-your-feature.sh

# Run integration tests
./tests/integration/test-your-feature.sh
```

### Requirement: Tests for New Features

All new features or behavioral changes MUST include tests demonstrating the intended behavior.

- If the change is a small utility or pure function, add a unit-like script under `tests/unit/` that exercises the function.
- For CLI behavior, add a quick integration test under `tests/integration/` that calls the command non-interactively (use `-f`/`--force` where appropriate) and asserts expected exit codes and outputs.
- For changes that touch libvirt/network or storage and cannot run in CI-hosted environments, add a documented integration test and mark it as `manual` or provide a self-hosted runner workflow.

How to run the repository test-suite (added):

```bash
# Syntax + shellcheck checks
./lib/utils/test-suite.sh --syntax

# Quick tests (recommended for CI)
./lib/utils/test-suite.sh --quick

# Full tests (requires self-hosted runner with libvirt/qemu)
DCVM_CI_ALLOW_FULL=yes sudo ./lib/utils/test-suite.sh --full
```

Include the tests in your PR and reference them in the PR description. CI must pass for the PR to be merged.

## Documentation

### Required Documentation

1. **Code comments** - Explain complex logic
2. **Function descriptions** - What each function does
3. **Usage examples** - How to use your feature
4. **README updates** - If it's a major feature

### Documentation Guidelines

- Keep language simple and clear
- Include examples for complex features
- Update existing docs if behavior changes
- Add screenshots if relevant (for UI features)

## Pull Request Process

       ;;
   ```

1. Add to `config/dcvm.conf.example`
2. Document in `docs/installation.md`
3. Use in scripts via `load_dcvm_config`

### Creating Documentation

1. Determine the right location:
   - Installation → `docs/installation.md`
   - Usage → `docs/usage.md`
   - Examples → `docs/examples/`
   - Architecture → `docs/project-structure.md`

2. Use clear Markdown formatting
3. Include code examples
4. Add to README navigation if needed
